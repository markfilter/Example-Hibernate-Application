# Example-Hibernate-Application

This project serves as an example for using Hibernate with Java to provide an ORM supported CRUD environment for marshaling data with a SQLite persistent store. (Yes, I geeked out wording this thing.)

## Getting Started

1. Open up Terminal (on a Mac...who develops on Windows anyway!)
2. CD into the directory to where you'd like to have the project files live.
for example...
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
```
3. Clone that thing!
```
$ git clone https://github.com/markfilter/Example-Hibernate-Application.git
```
4. Drag the folder over your icon for IntelliJ IDEA.
5. Refresh gradle.build, build the project, and enjoy the code reference.
